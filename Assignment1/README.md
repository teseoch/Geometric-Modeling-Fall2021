# Assignment 1: Hello World


In this exercise you will:

 * Familiarize yourself with `igl` and the mesh viewer in `meshplot`.
 * Get acquainted with some basic mesh programming by evaluating surface normals, computing mesh connectivity and isolating connected components.
 * Implement a simple mesh subdivision scheme.


## First steps with igl
The first task is to familiarize yourself with some of the basic code infrastructure provided by `igl`.

### Datastructures
In `igl`, a mesh is typically represented by a set of two `numpy` arrays, V and F.
V is a float or double array (dimension #V x 3 where #V is the number of vertices) that
contains the positions of the vertices of the mesh, where the i-th row of V
contains the coordinates of the i-th vertex.
F is an integer array (dimension #faces x 3 where #F is the number of faces) which contains the
descriptions of the triangles in the mesh. The i-th row of F contains the indices of the vertices in V that form the i-th face, ordered counter-clockwise.


Note that you need to install `numpy` manually with `conda install numpy`.

### Installing igl and Running the Tutorials

If you haven't already, install `igl` by
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge igl
```

Next, to run the tutorials you need to install the jupyther notebook
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
```
and download them from the [tutorial repository](https://github.com/libigl/libigl-python-bindings/tree/master/tutorial).


## Neighborhood Computations [3pt]
For this task, you will use `igl` to perform basic neighborhood computations on a mesh.
Computing the neighbors of a mesh face or vertex is required for most mesh processing operations, as you will see later in the class.
In order to use any function from `igl` (e.g. the function to compute per-face normals),
you must just import the package `import igl`.

### Vertex-to-Face Relations [1pt]
Given V and F, generate an adjacency list that contains, for each vertex, a
list of faces adjacent to it. The ordering of the faces incident on a vertex
does not matter. Your program should print out the vertex-to-face relations.

*Relevant `igl` functions:* `igl.vertex_triangle_adjacency`.

### Vertex-to-Vertex Relations [1pt]
Given V and F, generate an adjacency list that contains, for each vertex, a
list of vertices connected with it. Two vertices are connected if there exists
an edge between them, i.e., if the two vertices appear in the same row of F. The
ordering of the vertices in each list does not matter.  Your program should
print out the vertex-to-vertex relations.

*Relevant `igl` functions:* `igl.adjacency_list`.


### Visualizing the Neighborhood Relations [1pt]
Check your results by comparing them to raw data inside F.

Required output of this section:

 * A print of the content of the two data structures for the provided mesh `bunny.off`.

## Shading [6pt]
For this task, you will experiment with the different ways of shading discrete surfaces already implemented in `igl`.
Display the mesh with the appropriate shading.

Use `meshplot.plot(v,f, n=n, shading={"flat": False})` to set the shading in the viewer to use the normals `n` you computed.

You can visualise normals `n` by using meshplot as following
```python
p = meshplot.plot(v, f, n=n, shading={"flat": False})
p.add_lines(v, v + 0.01*n)
```
The scaling `0.01` is used to scale the lines to a reasonable size; that is, for the cube `0.5` is ok, while for the sphere `0.01` is better.


*Note:* `meshplot` supports only per-vertex normals; thus, to visualize the different shading you will need to "explode" the mesh. That is, separate all faces and duplicate vertices. For instance, if the mesh has faces `f=[[0, 1, 2], [1, 3, 2]]` (with vertices `1` and `2` shared among the two faces), `exploded_f=[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]` with the vertices `3` and `5` being a copy of vertices `1` and `2`. Note that `igl` will give you per-vertex, per-face, and per-vertex-per-face quantities, so you will need to compute and store an index mapping from the input mesh to the exploded one.

### Flat Shading [2pt]
![](img/face.png?raw=true)


The simplest shading technique is flat shading, where each polygon of an object
is colored based on the angle between the polygon's surface normal and the
direction of the light source, their respective colors, and the intensity of the
light source. With flat shading, all vertices of a polygon are colored
identically. Your program should compute the appropriate shading normals and shade
the input mesh with flat shading.

*Relevant `igl` functions:* `igl.per_face_normals`.


### Per-vertex Shading [2pt]
![](img/vertex.png?raw=true)

Flat shading may produce visual artifacts, due to the color discontinuity
between neighboring faces. Specular highlights may be rendered poorly with flat
shading. When per-vertex shading is used, per-vertex normals are computed for
each vertex by averaging the normals of the surrounding faces. Your program
should compute the appropriate shading normals and shade the input mesh with
per-vertex shading.

*Relevant `igl` functions:* `igl.per_vertex_normals`.


### Per-corner Shading [2pt]
![](img/corner.png?raw=true)

On models with sharp feature lines, averaging the per-face normals on the feature, as done for per-vertex shading, may result in blurred rendering. It is possible to avoid this limitation and to render crisp sharp features by using per-corner normals. In this case, a different normal is assigned to each face corner; this implies that every vertex will get a (possibly different) normal for every adjacent face. A threshold parameter is used to decide when an edge belongs to a sharp feature. The threshold is applied to the angle between the two corner normals: if it is less than the threshold value, the normals must be averaged, otherwise they are kept untouched. Your program should compute the appropriate shading normals (with a threshold of your choice) and shade the input mesh with per-vertex shading.

*Relevant `igl` functions:* `igl.per_corner_normals`.

Compare the result with the one obtained with flat and per-vertex shading. Experiment with the threshold value.


Required output of this section:

 * Plot of the provided meshes shaded with flat, per-vertex, and per-corner normals.


## Connected Components [3pt]
![](img/components.png?raw=true)

Using neighborhood connectivity, it is possible to partition a mesh into
connected components, where each mesh face belongs only to a single
component. Fill in the appropriate source code sections to display the mesh with each face colored to indicate the
component it belongs to (coloring each component distinctly).


*Relevant `igl` functions:* `igl.face_components`

Call `meshplot.plot(v, f, c=c)`, where `c` is the computed labels to display colors to the per-face colors you computed.


Required output of this section:

 * Plot of the provided meshes with each connected component colored differently.
 * Print of the number of connected components and the size of each component (measured in number of faces) for all the provided models.



## A simple subdivision scheme [8pt]

![](img/sqrt.png?raw=true)

√3 Subdivision. From left to right: original mesh, added
vertices at the midpoints of the faces (step 1), connecting the new points
to the original mesh (step 1), flipping the original edges to obtain a new
set of faces (step 3). Step 2 involves shifting the original vertices and is
not shown.

For this task, you will implement the subdivision scheme described in
[Kobbelt00sqrt(3)-subdivision](https://www.graphics.rwth-aachen.de/media/papers/sqrt31.pdf) to
iteratively create finer meshes from a given coarse mesh.
According to the paper, given a mesh `(V, F)`, the √3-subdivision scheme creates a new mesh `(V', F')`
by applying the following rules:

 1. Add a new vertex at location `m_f` for each face `f` in `F` of the original mesh.
    The new vertex will be located at the midpoint of the face.
    Append the newly created vertices `M = {m_f}` to `V` to create a new set of vertices `V'' = [V; M]`.
    Add three new faces for each face f in order by connecting `m_f` with edges to the original 3
    vertices of the face; we call the set of this newly created faces `F''`.
    <!-- Replace the old set of faces `F` with `F''`. -->
 2. Move each vertex `v` of the old vertices `V` to a new position `p` by averaging `v` with the positions of its neighboring vertices in the *original* mesh.
    If `v` has valence `n` and its neighbors in the original mesh `(V, F)` are `v_0`, `v_1`, ...,  `v_n`, then the update rule is<br/>
    ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p=(1-a_n)v&plus;\frac{a_n}{n}\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n-1}v_i)<br/>
    <!-- p = (1-a_n) v + \frac{a_n}{n}\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n-1} v_i -->where<br/>
    ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?a_n=\frac{4-2\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)}{9}.)<br/>
    <!-- a_n=\frac{4-2\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)}{9} -->
    The vertex set of the subdivided mesh is then `V' = [P, M]`, where `P` is the concatenation of the new positions `p` for all vertices.
  3. Replace the `F''` with a new set of faces `F'` such that the edges connecting the newly added points `M` to `P`
    (the relocated original vertices) remain but the original edges of the mesh connecting points in `M` to each other are flipped.



![](img/subdivision.png?raw=true)

Fill in the appropriate source code sections to display and subdivide the mesh.

*Relevant `igl` functions:* Many options possible.
Some suggestions: `adjacency_list`, `triangle_triangle_adjacency`, `edge_topology`, `barycenter`.


Required output of this section:

* Plot of the subdivided meshes.
