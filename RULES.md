# General Rules and Instructions

## Plagiarism Note and Late Policy
Copying code (either from other students or from external sources) is strictly
prohibited! We will be using automatic anti-plagiarism tools, and any violation
of this rule will lead to expulsion from the class. Late submissions will
generally not be accepted.

## Provided Libraries
For each assignment, you will use the geometry processing library [libigl](https://github.com/libigl/libigl/), which includes implementations of many of the algorithms presented in class.
In particular you will be using the [python bindings of igl](https://libigl.github.io/libigl-python-bindings/).

The `libigl` library includes a set of tutorials, an introduction to which can be found in the two previous links. You are advised to look over the relevant tutorials before starting the implementation for the assignments; you are also encouraged to examine the source code of all the library functions that you use in your code to see how they were
implemented.

`meshplot` is a simple, and fast 2d and 3d mesh viewer based on `pythreejs`. You can find the documentation [here](https://skoch9.github.io/meshplot/).



No libraries apart from `libigl`, `numpy`, `meshplot`, and `scipy` are permitted unless permission is granted in advance.

## Installing igl in Python

Before we can begin, you must install `igl`, `meshplot`, and `jupiter` trough conda-forge
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge igl
conda install -c conda-forge meshplot
conda install scipy
conda install jupyter
```

### Using jupyter notebook
Launch the notebook
```
jupyter notebook
```

### Using jupyter lab
You need first install `nodejs` with version >= 12.0.0, e.g.
```bash
conda install nodejs==14.7.0 -c conda-forge
```
Next install jupyter lab with version < 3.0, e.g.
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab==2.2.0
```
Then install two jupyter lab extensions
```bash
jupyter labextension install jupyter-threejs
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
```
Now you will be able to launch the jupyter lab and see meshplot displays.
```bash
jupyter lab
```

Or you can simply download the file `environment.yml` uploaded to create conda env and all these should have already been set up. The first line of the `yml` file sets the environment's name.
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

To install the package manager conda we refer to its [website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
